# natsuki
Natsuki is a next generation audio player built to handle multiple streaming services for music. Currently we will work to support YT Music & Deezer. 

## FAQ
### How does it work?
Natsuki will combine your two streaming services and allow you to create mixed playlists that have music from either service. When both services have a song you will be able to choose which service you wish to pull from. There is also a global priority option (defaulted to Deezer first, YT Music second.)

We eventually plan to support saving your mixed playlists to the cloud to load later and share with others. This is currently not supported. 
### Can you support Spotify?
Currently at this time we have no plans to support Spotify due to the work needed to support it. We do support loading your Spotify playlists into Natsuki, however, music will be pulled from either YT Music or Deezer.
### Why can't I get high quality audio from Deezer?
It is possible you're using a free Deezer account. Deezer limits you to 128kbps audio unless you pay. 
### Can I get this on mobile?
We're planning on building a native Android app for this, however this is down the line at the moment.
